== Timer/Counter 0 ==
File: board/PC_MB_001/clock.c

Used for the primary system clock, generating a software interrupt at 375 Hz.
This is based on the system clock crystal which should tick at 12 MHz, but may
not be completely accurate.


== Timer/Counter 2 ==
File: drivers/wallclock.c

Used to keep accurate wall-clock time using the 32.768 KHz clock output from the
DS1307 RTC.


== SPI ==
File: drivers/spi.c

SPI driver. All SPI operations should use this driver.


== USART 0 and 1 ==
File: drivers/uart.c

UART driver. All UART operations should use this driver.


== TWI / I2C ==
File: drivers/i2c.c

I2C driver. All I2C operations should use this driver.
